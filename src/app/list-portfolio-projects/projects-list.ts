While battling, players can also use a chat feature to send messages back and forth. The app is fully mobile responsive and works across all platforms. In the team in CSCI 415: Networking and Parallel Computation, I was the primary front-end designer, gameplay designer, and systems architect. I also advised other group members on the usage of the PeerJS library and how to incorporate it into their code. (If you would like to test the game alone, simply open the site in two tabs!)",
